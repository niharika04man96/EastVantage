# Overview
This repository has one locator file named locator.robot and one photo named photo.jpg.
The locator file contains keywords, variables where I am writing all my locators and configuration.
Created one "perform suite setup" keyword and for tear-down I am using "close all browser keyword" from selenium.
Then created one main test case where I have used all my keywords as a test steps.
